# Pokedex Project
## This idea was taken from this list: https://github.com/florinpop17/weekly-projects

## Description:
This is a personal solo adventure part of a year-long project goal,
I wanted to try and make and improve my coding skills by trying developing projects.

# Features:
Searching Pokemon's Name
Pokemon's Type, Sprite, Ability, and Description appear

# Bonus Features:
Pokemon's Stats with different Bars
Pokemon's Moveset
Abilities and Item descriptions and sprites

For the sake of simplicity and this being a solo project,
I am nulling Google Tests and Mocks.

### This is week 1 of the year-long project goal
